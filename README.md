# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

I was put in charge of reviewing data for a ride sharing company, Pyber. The hope is that data analysis provided will help the company invest 

in areas to grow the company. Using our new tools, Matplotlib, Pyplot, Numpy, etc, I was able to visualize the data. I plan on providing two 

suggestions for areas of improvement and or growth.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

As you can see from the line chart, Urban has the most demand for rides followed by Suburban and Rural. Rural ride shares perform 

better on average but there is also a much smaller data size. The average fare per ride is $34.62 and average fare per drver is 

$55.49. However, the total sum of fares is on $4,372.93. Compared to urban, average fare per ride is $24.53 and average fare per 

drive is $16.57, total fare is $39,854.38. For Suburban the values are as follows, $24.53 for average fare per ride, $39.50, for 

average fare per driver and total fares $19,356.33.



## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Below are three recommendations for addressing the disparities in the data. 

- Need to find a way to provide more drivers to Rural areas. While the demand is going to be lower. The cost to the customer is higher 

and some might not use our service.

- Cut back on total number of drivers in the Urban areas. We have more drivers than meets the demand of the market. 

- There could be more drivers in the Suburban areas.
